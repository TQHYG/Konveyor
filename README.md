<a id="get-started"></a>

## 🚀 Get started

```sh
git clone https://github.com/DevL0rd/Konveyor.git
cd Konveyor
./install.sh
```

That's it. The installer grabs what it needs, builds Konveyor for your exact KWin and switches it on, usually without even logging out. It also installs the [Konveyor widgets](#widgets), swaps your application launcher for the Kontrol Panel and opens it on **Shortcuts** so you can see everything Konveyor does.

> [!TIP]
> Press <kbd>Meta</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> any time to open the Kontrol Panel on **Shortcuts**: every shortcut, searchable, with a live diagram of what each Konveyor action does. Its gear, or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd>, jumps straight to Konveyor's settings.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>🔄 <b>Update</b></td>
    <td>Konveyor updates itself with every system update and rebuilds when KWin, Qt or Plasma update. On Fedora Atomic desktops and SteamOS that happens at your next login after an update. You can also run <code>./install.sh</code> again any time. It's safe to repeat and keeps your settings.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>📦 <b>From a package</b></td>
    <td>Package builds run <code>./install.sh --aur</code>, so your package manager handles updates instead.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>🧹 <b>Remove</b></td>
    <td>Run <code>./uninstall.sh</code>. Your shortcuts and window rules go back to how KDE had them.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>🧩 <b>Just the tiling</b></td>
    <td>Run <code>./install.sh --no-widgets</code> to skip the widgets, or <code>./uninstall.sh --keep-widgets</code> to remove only the window manager.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>🧊 <b>Atomic desktops</b></td>
    <td>On Fedora Atomic desktops like Kinoite, Aurora and Bazzite, the installer builds Konveyor in a toolbox that matches your system's KWin exactly. On SteamOS it uses a distrobox that matches Valve's packages. Either way it installs to <code>~/.local</code>, so the read-only system stays untouched. Log out and back in once after the first install. After a system update, Konveyor rebuilds itself at your next login.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>🖥️ <b>Needs</b></td>
    <td>KDE Plasma 6.7 or newer on Wayland.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>🐧 <b>Distros</b></td>
    <td>The installer sets everything up on Arch and Arch-based systems like CachyOS, Fedora, openSUSE Tumbleweed, Debian testing and Fedora Atomic desktops like Kinoite, Aurora and Bazzite, plus SteamOS 3.9 and newer in Desktop Mode (on the Preview update channel for now). Kubuntu 26.04, Debian 13 and SteamOS 3.8 still ship an older Plasma.</td>

## 🎬 See it move

### ↔️ One endless row

Every new window gets its own column right next to the one you're using. When the row runs past the edge of your screen it simply scrolls, so a laptop shows two windows and an ultrawide shows five — from the same row. Tap a key to cycle a column through a third, half and two thirds of the screen, or let it fill whatever space is free.

<p align="center"><img alt="An ultrawide monitor showing four columns side by side" src="docs/screenshot.png" width="88%"></p>

### 🖥️ Built for multiple screens

Konveyor supports multi-monitor setups natively. Each display keeps its own scrolling row and workspace stack, windows move freely between screens, and per-monitor profiles let a laptop, ultrawide and portrait display each use the layout that fits it best.

### 🗂️ Stack them. Tab them.

Pull a window into the column next to it to stack them, then flip the column into tabs when you want one at a time. Kick it back out whenever you like.

<p align="center"><img alt="Stacking windows in a column and switching to tabs" src="docs/media/stack-and-tabs.gif" width="88%"></p>

### 🎮 Fullscreen that doesn't trap you

Games and videos stay fullscreen and untouched. Move left or right and your other columns slide in over the top as an overlay, with a soft shade at the edge — move back and they slide away until it's just your fullscreen app again.

<p align="center"><img alt="Columns sliding over a fullscreen app" src="docs/media/fullscreen-overlay.gif" width="88%"></p>

### 🧱 Workspaces that stack up

Workspaces live above and below each other and appear the moment you need one. Send a column down to a fresh workspace and carry on.

<p align="center"><img alt="Moving between stacked workspaces" src="docs/media/workspaces.gif" width="88%"></p>

### 🪟 Float anything

Some windows don't belong in a row. Lift one out with a single key, move it and resize it freely like any normal Plasma window, then drop it back in. Dialogs and pop-ups float on their own.

<p align="center"><img alt="Floating a window out of the row and back" src="docs/media/floating.gif" width="88%"></p>

### 📱 Portrait screens stack up

<table>
  <tr>
    <td width="36%" valign="top"><img alt="Windows stacking two to a column on a portrait monitor" src="docs/media/portrait.gif"></td>
    <td valign="top">
      <br>
      Turn a monitor on its side and Konveyor turns with it. Every column fills the full width and holds two windows, one above the other, so a tall screen shows two apps at a time without squeezing either of them.
      <br><br>
      New windows fill the focused column first, then start the next one. Rotate the screen back and the row returns to your normal widths.
      <br><br>
      It's just a monitor profile, so you can pick how many windows stack, or give any other screen the same treatment, under <b>Settings → Monitors</b>.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<a id="touch"></a>

### 👆 Made for touch

Touchpads and touchscreens get the whole row under your fingers. Slide three fingers to scroll the row or change workspace, use four to carry windows around, and tap to resize.

<p align="center"><img alt="Touch gestures scrolling the row, switching workspaces, merging windows and cycling widths" src="docs/media/touch.gif" width="88%"></p>

| Gesture | What happens |
| :-- | :-- |
| 3 fingers ← → | Scroll the row |
| 3 fingers ↑ ↓ | Switch to the workspace above or below |
| 4 fingers ← → | Merge the window into the next column, or pop it back out |
| 4 fingers ↑ ↓ | Move the window up or down its column, then to the next workspace |
| 4-finger pinch | Open or close KDE's Overview |
| 3-finger tap | Cycle the column width |
| 4-finger tap | Open the Kontrol Panel |
| Drag a title bar on a touchscreen | Scroll the row |
| Hold a title bar on a touchscreen, then drag | Move the window |

The swipes, pinch and taps work on touchpads and touchscreens alike. Pick other finger counts, flip natural swiping or hand a gesture back to KDE on the **Touch & Gestures** settings page.

## 🧩 Konveyor widgets

Konveyor comes with a set of Plasma widgets built to match: a full-screen launcher, system and process monitors, a router dashboard, a live system log and your Steam friends. Each one sits in your panel as a small, steady button and opens into a searchable dashboard. They also work as desktop widgets.

<p align="center"><img alt="The Kontrol Panel opening, searching, browsing games, shortcuts and settings" src="docs/media/widgets/launcher.gif" width="92%"></p>

### 🚀 Kontrol Panel

Press <kbd>Meta</kbd> and the desktop dims behind the Kontrol Panel, one place for your apps, games, friends, files, shortcuts and every Konveyor setting. Start typing and apps, games, friends, settings, shortcuts, files, maths, unit conversions, commands and even installable packages show up together, best match first.

### ⚙️ Setting them up

Everything the widgets need is installed for you, and one background service feeds all of them. A few need a detail only you have:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>📡 <b>Router Monitor</b></td>
    <td>Enter your router's address in the Router Monitor to connect it, or add the address, user and your AdGuard Home URL and login to <code>~/.config/Linux-Router-Monitor/config.json</code>, then run <code>./install.sh</code> again.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>👥 <b>Steam friends</b></td>
    <td>Paste a free <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey">Steam Web API key</a> into the Steam Friends widget, or into <code>~/.config/Plasma-App-Portal/config.json</code>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>🎮 <b>FPS</b></td>
    <td>Process Monitor reads window update rates through its own independent KWin telemetry plugin, with no overlay or log files.</td>

## 🎛️ Settings that show you

Every Konveyor setting lives in the Kontrol Panel. Press <kbd>Meta</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> and open **Settings** at the bottom of the sidebar, hit the gear, or press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd>. The same pages are in **System Settings → Window Management → Konveyor** and behind **Configure** next to Konveyor under Desktop Effects, so they're there without the widgets too. Every option has a live preview, changes apply instantly, and Undo takes them back.

Change anything from the **Shortcuts** settings page. The 3- and 4-finger swipes replace KDE's desktop-switching and Overview swipes; pick other finger counts, or turn gestures off, on the **Touch & Gestures** settings page.

<a id="faq"></a>

## 💬 Questions

<details>
<summary><b>Does it replace Plasma or KWin?</b></summary>
<br>
No. Konveyor is a KWin effect that decides where windows go. Everything else — panels, widgets, themes, the lock screen, KRunner — is still plain Plasma.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Do games and fullscreen video work?</b></summary>
<br>
Yes. Fullscreen apps are never moved or resized, whether they run natively or through XWayland, and you can still reach your other windows on top of them.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does it work on X11?</b></summary>
<br>
Konveyor runs in the Plasma Wayland session. X11 apps running through XWayland are tiled like everything else.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I tweak things beyond the settings page?</b></summary>
<br>
Everything the settings page changes lives in one readable file, and there's a command line tool for scripting. See <a href="docs/configuration.md">docs/configuration.md</a>.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Do the widgets slow my system down?</b></summary>
<br>
No. A single background service collects everything they show, and the dashboards only update while you can see them. Close a popup or cover a desktop widget and it goes quiet.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I keep my old application launcher?</b></summary>
<br>
Yes. Install with <code>./install.sh --no-widgets</code>, or put the launcher back from your panel's Add Widgets menu. Uninstalling the widgets restores the launcher you had.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I get my old desktop back?</b></summary>
<br>
Turn Konveyor off under <b>Desktop Effects</b>, or run <code>./uninstall.sh</code>. Your shortcuts and window rules are restored.
</details>
